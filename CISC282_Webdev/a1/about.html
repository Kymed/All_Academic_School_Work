            <p>Agriculture is a highly multi-disciplinary field; students 
                can expect to study mathematics, 
                biology, chemistry, economics and sociology. It is vital to 
                understand all of the factors that affect food sustainability and 
                ensure or threaten food security.</p>
            <p>
                Agricultural production systems are facing increasing competition from other 
                sectors for limited natural resources. The availability of these resources and 
                their quality are also being affected by unsustainable management practices and 
                changing climatic and weather conditions. To respond to this situation, the 
                agriculture sectors must improve their sustainability performance and adapt 
                to the impacts of climate change in ways that do not compromise global efforts 
                to ensure food security for all. These challenges are intimately and inextricably 
                related,
                    and need to be addressed simultaneously. --- Climate Smart Agriculture
